After our presentation, and taking into account the different opinions heard we have made some changes in our final work.

The first one has been changing the letter style used, as well as hiz size and color in some cases. We have continue with the buttons,
changing their color and making some other small changes in order to improve the result shown.

To conclude we have added our names and the link to our github page and explanation in the footer of the web page.

This are the main changes in our project, because, even if some classmates suggested us to modify the way the slider works we think that it is easier to use it as it is done, it makes it more userfriendly and comfortable to the user.
